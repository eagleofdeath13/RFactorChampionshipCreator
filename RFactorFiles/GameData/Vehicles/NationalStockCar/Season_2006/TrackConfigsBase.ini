// This file is used to specify that certain upgrade configurations must
// be used at certain tracks.  Any file named TrackConfig*.ini in the
// same directory as an upgrades.ini file will be concatenated to this
// list of configurations.  That may come in useful if a whole new set
// of tracks is introduced by somebody.
//
// Alternately, files dropped in specific track directories that are
// named VehicleConfig*.ini can be used and will override any entries
// in this file.  The format of the VehicleConfig*.ini file is slightly
// different, taking a <VehicleClassSetting> to match the vehicle, rather
// than a <TrackName> to match the track.  The VehicleClassSetting for
// a given vehicle can be found at the top of a relevant SVM file.
//
// Specifying a certain upgrade configuration in this file can be done
// one of two ways:
//
// "<TrackName>" = "<ClassPackage>"
//
// In this case, <TrackName> matches the TrackName given in any track GDB
// file, and <ClassPackage> matches one of the "UpgradeClass" entries in
// the upgrades.ini file.  In addition, <TrackName> may be the wildcard
// '*' which will be used as the default if no other matches are found.
//
// The second way is to specify specific upgrades in a list:
//
// "<TrackName>":
// Rear Spoiler=2
// Suspension=1
//  <etc.>
//
// <TrackName> is, again, either a TrackName from a track GDB file or the
// wildcard '*'.  This must be followed with a colon and then a list of
// newline-delimited upgrade type settings.  This list must end with one
// empty line before the next configuration is specified.
//
// As a final note, mismatches due to the client missing or altering one of
// these files should result in the explanation "X.HDV or Track Config" mismatch.

// You can force track configuration for all other tracks by using wildcard '*'. For example;
//"*":
//Track Configuration=3
// Would force road course config at all other tracks that have not been specified above.
// Though it could still be overriden by using VehicleConfig*.ini in the track folder.
